**Wearable**  
**Unlimited** (open source general-purpose)  
**Computer**  
**Yeah..!**  

based on ESP32-PICO-D4 running FreeRTOS on my custom Therram kernel. 

It will not make your life easier. Seriously, there's plenty of IoT crap out there already.
It's a Computer on your wrist.  
It's to have fun.  

I encourage you to help me build a community around this project for nerds like me and You (it' a compliment!). Not sure how this github thing works, you see, I'm an amateur hacker so DM me if you think you can help me kickstart this project.

My vision is to create a hardware and software platform - custom kernel wrapped in FreeRTOS with basic but sexy GUI, easy access to system hardware, external file storage etc. Another key factor is to make an API framework for easy application developement for hackers, my biggest goal is to spark somewhat of a community :). All code in C, no Arduino or simmilar frameworks, I want this wearable to be fast, open and sexy. All of my contribution will be under Open Hardware and Open Software license (not sure which, never done this, lol).
