### **Wearable**  
### **Unlimited** (open source general-purpose)  
### **Computer**  
### **Yeah..!**  

based on ESP32-PICO-D4 running FreeRTOS on my custom therram kernel. 

It's not a watch.
It's a Computer on your wrist.
It will not make your life easier.
It's to have fun.  

Nor it's a smartwatch.
I dislike the "smart" part in tech.
It's stupid.

I encourage you to help me build a community around this project for nerds like you and me (it' a compliment!). I'm not sure how this github thing works, I'm an amateur hacker so DM me if you think you can help me kickstart this project. Although Im quite happy working alone in current progress stage.

## Vision

My vision is to create hardware & software platform and spark a community of hackers around it :). Big attention to software: Custom kernel wrapped in FreeRTOS with basic but sexy GUI, easy access to system hardware, external file storage etc. Another key factor is to make an API framework for easy application developement. Would like to create a bootloader that could let load precompiled applications such as game from storage to RAM and run it within OS. All code in C, no Arduino or simmilar frameworks, I want this wearable to be fast, open and sexy. All of my contribution will be under Open Hardware and Open Software licenses (not sure which, never done this, lol).
